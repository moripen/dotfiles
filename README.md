# dotfiles

My Development Setup

## Quickstart

First, you need to [install Brew](https://brew.sh). After which, you'll need to [get YADM going](https://yadm.io/docs/install).

```shell
moripen@something-mac-something ~ % yadm clone git@github.com:moripen/dotfiles.git
moripen@something-mac-something ~ % brew bundle
moripen@something-mac-something ~ % sh bootstrap.sh
```

The last command will run for a while. It runs all Mac OSX defaults and stuff, so â€“ i'll take some time!
